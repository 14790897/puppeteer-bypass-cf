  <h3 align="center">Puppeteer Real Browser</h3>

  <p align="center">
    This package prevents Puppeteer from being detected as a bot in services like Cloudflare and allows you to pass captchas without any problems. It behaves like a real browser.

## Installation

If you are using a Linux operating system, xvfb must be installed for the library to work correctly.


```bash
npm i puppeteer-real-browser
```

if you are using linux:

```bash
sudo apt-get install xvfb
```



## Include

### CommanJS

```js

const start = async () => {
    var { connect } = await import('puppeteer-real-browser')
    const { page, browser } = await connect({})
}

```
### Module

```js

import { connect } from 'puppeteer-real-browser'

const { page, browser } = await connect({})

```

## Usage


```js
import { connect } from 'puppeteer-real-browser'

connect({

    headless: 'auto',

    args: [],

    customConfig: {},

    skipTarget: [],

    fingerprint: false,

    turnstile: true,

    connectOption: {},

    fpconfig: {},

    // proxy:{
    //     host:'<proxy-host>',
    //     port:'<proxy-port>',
    //     username:'<proxy-username>',
    //     password:'<proxy-password>'
    // }

})
.then(async response => {
    const {browser, page} = response
    await page.goto('<url>')
    
})
.catch(error=>{
    console.log(error.message)
})

```

**headless**: auto can take the values true and false. If auto is set, it uses the option that is stable on the operating system in use.

**args:** If there is an additional flag you want to add when starting Chromium, you can send it with this string.

**customConfig:** When launch is executed, the variables you send in be onje are added. For example, you can specify the browser path with executablePath.

**skipTarget:** It uses target filter to avoid detection. You can send the targets you want to allow. This feature is in beta. Its use is not recommended.

**fingerprint:** If set to true, it injects a unique fingerprint ID into the page every time the browser is launched and prevents you from being caught. **Not recommended if not mandatory. May cause detection. runs the puppeteer-afp library.**

**turnstile:** Cloudflare Turnstile automatically clicks on Captchas if set to true

**connectOption:** The variables you send when connecting to chromium created with puppeteer.connect are added
**fpconfig:** This setting allows you to reuse fingerprint values that you have previously saved in the puppeteer-afp library. Please refer to the puppeteer-afp library documentation for details.

For example, if you want to open a 2nd page, you can use this library as follows.

```js

import { connect } from 'puppeteer-real-browser'

connect({
    turnstile: true
})
.then(async response => {
        const { page, browser, setTarget } = response

        page.goto('https://nopecha.com/demo/cloudflare', {
            waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded'
        })

        setTarget({ status: false })

        let page2 = await browser.newPage();

        setTarget({ status: true })

        await page2.goto('https://nopecha.com/demo/cloudflare');
})

```
